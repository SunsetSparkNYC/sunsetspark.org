                <p>Students learn how to create their own video games using code. We offer versions of this class for 3rd through 8th grade classes and students.  Younger grades learn how to code using tablet coding environments to create games and interactive stories. For older grades, students learn how to program in JavaScript and use professional tools to develop web and mobile games.</p>

                <p>Study the neurological and cognitive development from conception to the teen year. Parents explore the growth of your child's brain starting from just a handful of cells all the way through to middle school. Parents learn how babies learn, grow a better understanding of the neurocognitive stages of infancy and childhood, and discover scientifically-backed ways to nurture your child's growing brain.</p>
