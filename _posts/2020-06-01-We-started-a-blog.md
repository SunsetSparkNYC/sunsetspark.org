Welcome to Wildcard Characters, Sunset Spark's official blog. Every blog needs a
first post, and this is ours.

We'll be writing here about our work teaching creative science and technology
classes to new Americans. We'll be writing about CS and STEM education, the
CS4All movement, what it can take to run a not-for-profit, creating projects
and curriculum for the classroom. We'll also post our streaming and workshop
schedules and activities for teachers and parents.
