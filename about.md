This team of two and a half founded Sunset Spark in 2012 to help bring more creative engineering and science classes to misserved families in Sunset Park.  They eat, sleep, and breath Sunset Spark!

Yadira has a B.A. in International Studies from Seattle University and an M.Ed. in Social & Comparative Analysis in Education Program from the University of Pittsburgh.  She served in Peace Corp as a primary and secondary teacher in Bulgaria.  After graduate school, she ran a large, highly regarded K-5 bilingual after school program focusing on social emotional learning.  She co-founded Sunset Spark to bring more fun and creative science classes to immigrant families.

Gaelen holds a B.S. and M.S. in computer science from the University of Central Florida.  In his 10 years as a professional developer, he built useful things like medical language learning software, playful things like mobile games, and reckless things like weapon training systems.  He started teaching experimental tech classes to K-8 students early on in his coding career.  When he isn't teaching or coding, he's finishing his research at Teachers College, Columbia University for an M.S. in Neuroscience and Education.
