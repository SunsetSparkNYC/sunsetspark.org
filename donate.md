  <p style="padding-top: 0;">With the impact of COVID, there is no more urgent time than now to have access to equitable education. Our programs quickly moved online and hybrid in March. As we delivered project materials door to door, we witnessed the urgent need of tech support for familiesâ€”fixing devices and internet connection so that they can get online to make human connections. The indispensableness of our work is balanced with joyous smiles and <i>mucho gracias</i>'s as kids join their online classes for the first time in weeks. School budgets are frozen and slashed with programs for students and training for teachers being pulled. Typically our program revenue covers operation costs, but partners don't have the funds this year.</p>

  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Every year we teach over 2,500 students robotics, computer science, game design, and other creative technology and science subjects. Over 95% of our students are first and second generation immigrant families. We run free monthly teacher workshops and family events to help the whole community have fun with science and technology. Your donation helps us keep our doors open.
