  <p>Sunset Spark needs your help. Due to the pandemic, we have less than two months of funds left. Without donors like you, we will will need to shut our doors. As a 501(c)3 org, your tax-deductible donation will help us bring more creative technology and science programs to families in Brooklyn.</p>
  <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5em;">Every year we teach over 2,000 students robotics, computer science, game design, and other creative technology and science subjects. Over 95% of our students are first and second generation immigrant families. We run free monthly teacher workshops and family events to help the whole community have fun with science and technology. Your donation helps us keep our doors open.
